NIST Cybersecurity Framework Mapping for LLMs 2025
==================================================

This framework maps NIST Cybersecurity Framework risk categories to LLM-specific threats and vulnerabilities.
It includes realistic attack techniques and weaknesses tied to each category.

Each category includes:
- Attacks: Techniques for exploiting or bypassing LLM security.
- Vulnerabilities: Weaknesses that can be exploited in LLM systems.
