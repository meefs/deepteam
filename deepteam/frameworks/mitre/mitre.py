MITRE ATT&CK Framework Mapping for LLMs 2025
===========================================

This framework maps MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques to LLM-specific threats and vulnerabilities.
It includes red-teaming attack methods and corresponding weaknesses tied to each MITRE category.

Each category includes:
- Attacks: Techniques for exploiting, bypassing, or manipulating LLM systems.
- Vulnerabilities: Weaknesses that can be leveraged by attackers in LLM models.
