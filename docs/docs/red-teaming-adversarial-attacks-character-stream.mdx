<AttackTagsDisplayer singleTurn={true} />

The `CharacterStream` attack method enhances a baseline attack by adding spaces between each character, simulating character-by-character input that can bypass simple input filters.

## Usage

```python title="main.py"
from deepteam import red_team
from deepteam.vulnerabilities import Bias
from deepteam.attacks.single_turn import CharacterStream
from somewhere import your_callback

character_stream = CharacterStream(weight=2)

red_team(
    attacks=[character_stream], 
    vulnerabilities=[Bias()], 
    model_callback=your_callback
)
```

There are **ONE** optional parameter when creating a `CharacterStream` attack:

- [Optional] `weight`: an integer that determines this attack method's selection probability, proportional to the total weight sum of all `attacks` during red teaming. Defaulted to `1`.

:::note
The `weight` is only applicable for the `red_team` function and does not apply when used as a standalone.
:::

### As a standalone

You can enhance any attack using the `enhance` method:

```python
from deepteam.attacks.single_turn import CharacterStream
from somewhere import your_callback

base_attack = "Your initial harmful prompt targeting a specific vulnerability"
character_stream = CharacterStream()

enhanced_attack = character_stream.enhance(base_attack)
print(enhanced_attack)
```

## Example

Here's an example enhancement on how `CharacterStream` attack works:

| **Base Attack**                           | **Enhanced Attack**                                                               |
