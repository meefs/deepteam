<AttackTagsDisplayer singleTurn={true} llmSimulated={true} />

The `PermissionEscalation` attack method enhances baseline attacks by attempting to shift the agent's perceived identity, capabilities, or operational context to bypass role-based security restrictions.

## Usage

```python title="main.py"
from deepteam import red_team
from deepteam.vulnerabilities import Bias
from deepteam.attacks.single_turn import PermissionEscalation
from somewhere import your_callback

permission_escalation = PermissionEscalation(weight=2, max_retires=7)

red_team(
    attacks=[permission_escalation], 
    vulnerabilities=[Bias()], 
    model_callback=your_callback
)
```

There are **TWO** optional parameters when creating a `RoleManipulation` attack:

- [Optional] `weight`: an integer that determines this attack method's selection probability, proportional to the total weight sum of all `attacks` during red teaming. Defaulted to `2`.
- [Optional] `max_retries`: an integer that specifies the number of times to retry simulating a Role Manipulation attack for any error that occurs. Defaulted to `3`.

:::note
The `weight` is only applicable for the `red_team` function and does not  when used as a standalone.
:::

### As a standalone

You can enhance any attack using the `enhance` method:

```python
from deepteam.attacks.single_turn import PermissionEscalation
from somewhere import your_callback

permission_escalation = "Your initial harmful prompt targeting a specific vulnerability"
role_manipulation = PermissionEscalation()

enhanced_attack = role_manipulation.enhance(permission_escalation)
print(enhanced_attack)
```

## Example

Here's an example enhancement on how role manipulation attack works:

| **Base Attack**                                          | **Enhanced Attack**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
