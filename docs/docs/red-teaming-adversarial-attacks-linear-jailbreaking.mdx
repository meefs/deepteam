The `LinearJailbreaking` attack enhances a _base attack_ — a harmful prompt targeting a specific vulnerability — and iteratively refines it using the **target LLM**'s responses. Each iteration builds on the last, gradually improving the attack's effectiveness against the target LLM to produce harmful outputs.

:::info
The linear jailbreaking process only terminates when the target LLM produces a harmful response or reaches the maximum number of turns.
:::

## Usage

```python title="main.py"
from deepteam import red_team
from deepteam.vulnerabilities import Bias
from deepteam.attacks.single_turn import Roleplay
from deepteam.attacks.multi_turn import LinearJailbreaking
from somewhere import your_callback

linear_jailbreaking = LinearJailbreaking(
    weight=5,
    num_turns=7,
    turn_level_attacks=[Roleplay()]
)

red_team(
    attacks=[linear_jailbreaking], 
    vulnerabilities=[Bias()], 
    model_callback=your_callback
)
```

There are **FOUR** optional parameters when creating a `LinearJailbreaking` attack:

- [Optional] `weight`: an integer that determines this attack method's selection probability, proportional to the total weight sum of all `attacks` during red teaming. Defaulted to `1`.
- [Optional] `num_turns`: an integer that specifies the number of turns to use in the attempt to jailbreak your LLM system. Defaulted to `5`.
- [Optional] `simulator_model`: a string specifying which of OpenAI's GPT models to use, **OR** [any custom LLM model](https://deepeval.com/guides/guides-using-custom-llms) of type `DeepEvalBaseLLM`. Defaulted to 'gpt-4o-mini'.
- [Optional] `turn_level_attacks`: a list of [single-turn attacks](/docs/red-teaming-adversarial-attacks-prompt-injection) that will be randomly sampled to enhance an attack inside turns.

### As a standalone

You can try to jailbreak your model on a single vulnerability using the `enhance` method:

```python
from deepteam.attacks.single_turn import Roleplay
from deepteam.attacks.multi_turn import LinearJailbreaking
from deepteam.vulnerabilities import Bias
from somewhere import your_callback

bias = Bias()
linear = LinearJailbreaking(
    weight=5, 
    num_turns=7, 
    turn_level_attacks=[Roleplay()]
)

result = linear.enhance(vulnerability=bias, model_callback=your_callback)
print(result)
```

## How It Works

`LinearJailbreaking` is an **iterative attack strategy** that gradually pushes a target LLM toward generating restricted or harmful outputs. It works in the following steps:

1. **Start from a base attack** — a prompt crafted to exploit a known vulnerability (e.g. bias, refusal handling).
2. **Get a response from the target LLM.**
3. **Refine the attack** by updating the prompt based on the LLM's response.
4. **Repeat** this process for a set number of turns (`num_turns`) or until a harmful output is generated.

Each step builds on the last, making the attack progressively more effective and better aligned with the model's behavior.

If the `turn_level_attacks` is supplied with a list of single-turn attacks, `LinearJailbreaking` adds controlled variation:

- At each turn, there's a **50% chance** of enhancing the current prompt with a **randomly selected attack** from the `turn_level_attacks` list (e.g., [`Roleplay`](/docs/red-teaming-adversarial-attacks-roleplay), [`PromptInjection`](/docs/red-teaming-adversarial-attacks-prompt-injection)).
- These injected attacks are still part of the same linear conversation and help explore alternate jailbreak angles without disrupting the overall structure.

:::note
This hybrid approach blends **predictable linear refinement** with **randomized variation**, increasing the chances of finding successful jailbreaks.

## Example

Here's an example of a `LinearJailbreaking` attack targeting a racial bias vulnerability:

![Linear Jailbreaking Example](https://deepteam-docs.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/attacks:linear-jailbreaking-example.png)

1. **First Attack**: The attacker starts with a direct prompt asking about negative stereotypes associated with mixed-race individuals, targeting the racial bias vulnerability in the model.
2. **Initial Response**: The model provides a safe, balanced response, acknowledging stereotypes but emphasizing the importance of challenging them.
3. **Refinement**: The attacker subtly reframes the prompt, introducing a more neutral or emotional context (e.g., pretending to be a reporter or concerned parent) to test the model's responses.
4. **Subsequent Turns**: The attacker refines the prompt further with each turn, adjusting based on the model's previous answers to find a way to provoke biased or harmful output.
5. **Successful Breach**: After several iterations, the attacker successfully bypasses the model's safeguards, prompting a harmful response that perpetuates stereotypes.
