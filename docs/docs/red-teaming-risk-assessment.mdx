## Quick Summary

In `deepteam`, after red teaming an LLM with your [adversarial attacks](/docs/red-teaming-adversarial-attacks) and [vulnerabilities](/docs/red-teaming-vulnerabilities), you receive a `RiskAssessment` object as the return value of the `red_team()` function. Here's an example walkthrough:

```python
from deepteam import red_team
from deepteam.vulnerabilities import Bias
from deepteam.attacks.single_turn import Roleplay
from somewhere import your_callback

risk_assessment = red_team(
    attacks=[Roleplay()], 
    vulnerabilities=[Bias()], 
    model_callback=your_callback,
    attacks_per_vulnerability_type=5
)
```

The `red_team` function simulates a base attack for a given vulnerability, enhances it using a random adversarial attack, and invokes the `model_callback` with the result to create test cases. It returns a `RiskAssessment` object summarizing the outcomes.

```

You can learn more about how the red teaming process works [here](/docs/red-teaming-test-case#what-is-red-teaming).

## What is a Risk Assessment

The `RiskAssessment` object is the return value the `red_team()` method, when you use the `red_team` function, `deepteam` automatically does the [red teaming process](/docs/red-teaming-test-case#what-is-red-teaming) and generates a list of `RTTestCases`. These test cases are populated with `score` and `reason` from their vulnerability evaluations.

These test cases are then used to build a complete red teaming report, encapsulated in a `RiskAssessment` object.

![Red Teaming Risk Assessment](https://deepteam-docs.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/docs:red-teaming-risk-assessment.png)

The `RiskAssessment` is constructed by categorizing test cases in two ways:

- By **vulnerability type**
- By **attack method**

For each category, `deepteam` calculates metrics such as **pass rate** and count of **passing**, **failing**, and **errored** test cases. These are summarized into `VulnerabilityTypeResult` and `AttackMethodResult` objects, which feed into a `RedTeamingOverview` â€” the high-level summary of system performance.

The final `RiskAssessment` object has two main attributes:

- `overview`: An instance of [`RedTeamingOverview`](#red-teaming-overview) object
- `test_cases`: List of all [`RTTestCases`](/docs/red-teaming-test-case) generated and evaluated

```python
class RiskAssessment(BaseModel):
    overview: RedTeamingOverview
    test_cases: List[RTTestCase]
```

You can easily convert the test cases or the overview to a pandas `DataFrame` using `.to_df()`:

```python
test_cases_df = risk_assessment.test_cases.to_df()
print(test_cases_df)
```

## Red Teaming Overview

The `RedTeamingOverview` is a top-level summary of performance across all attacks and vulnerabilities. You can access the `RedTeamingOverview` from a `RiskAssessment` as shown below:

```python
from deepteam import red_team

risk_assessment = red_team(...)
red_teaming_overview = risk_assessment.overview
```

This overview includes results grouped by **vulnerability type** and **attack method**, along with the total number of **errored test cases** encountered during the red teaming process. You can also convert it into a pandas `DataFrame` for further inspection:

```python
print(red_teaming_overview.to_df())
```

| Vulnerability | Vulnerability Type | Total | Pass Rate | Passing | Failing | Errored |
|---------------|--------------------|-------|-----------|---------|---------|---------|
| Bias          | politics           | 5     | 1.0       | 5       | 0       | 0       |
| Bias          | race               | 5     | 0.75      | 4       | 1       | 0       |
| Bias          | gender             | 5     | 0.0       | 0       | 5       | 0       |
| Bias          | religion           | 5     | 1.0       | 5       | 0       | 0       |

Here's the data model of `RedTeamingOverview`:

```python
class RedTeamingOverview(BaseModel):
    vulnerability_type_results: List[VulnerabilityTypeResult]
    attack_method_results: List[AttackMethodResult]
    errored: int
```

There are **THREE** attributes to this object:

- `vulnerability_type_results`: A list of [`VulnerabilityTypeResult`](#vulnerability-type-result) objects.
- `attack_method_results`: A list of [`AttackMethodResult`](#attack-method-result) objects
- `errored`: an `int` representing the number of errored test cases in the red teaming results.

## Vulnerability Type Result

The `VulnerabilityTypeResult` groups results by the **vulnerability** being tested. You can access the `VulnerabilityTypeResult` from a `RiskAssessment` as shown below:

```python
from deepteam import red_team

risk_assessment = red_team(...)
vuln_type_results = risk_assessment.overview.vulnerability_type_results
```

This object summarizes performance metrics for each vulnerability, including the **pass rate**, number of **passing**, **failing**, and **errored test cases**. You can also convert it to a pandas `DataFrame`:

```python
print(vuln_type_results.to_df())
```

| Vulnerability | Vulnerability Type | Pass Rate | Passing | Failing | Errored |
|---------------|--------------------|-----------|---------|---------|---------|
| Bias          | gender             | 0.0       | 0       | 5       | 0       |
| Bias          | race               | 0.75      | 4       | 1       | 0       |
| Bias          | politics           | 1.0       | 5       | 0       | 0       |
| Bias          | religion           | 1.0       | 5       | 0       | 0       |

Here's the data model of `VulnerabilityTypeResult`:

```python
class VulnerabilityTypeResult(BaseModel):
    vulnerability: str
    vulnerability_type: Union[VulnerabilityType, Enum]
    pass_rate: float
    passing: int
    failing: int
    errored: int
```

There are **SIX** attributes to this object:

- `vulnerability`: a `str` representing the name of the vulnerability
- `vulnerability_type`: an `Enum` representing a single `type` from the `types` of the vulnerability
- `pass_rate`: a `float` that represents the percentage of test cases that pass this vulnerability
- `passing`: an `int` representing the number of passing test cases
- `failing`: an `int` representing the number of failing test cases 
- `errored`: an `int` representing the number of errored test cases

:::info
A test case is considered a **pass** if the model successfully avoided falling for the attack. The criteria are defined per `BaseVulnerability`. 
:::

## Attack Method Result

The `AttackMethodResult` groups test cases by the **attack** strategy used. You can access the `AttackMethodResult` from a `RiskAssessment` as shown below:

```python
from deepteam import red_team

risk_assessment = red_team(...)
attack_results = risk_assessment.overview.attack_method_results
```

This object summarizes red teaming performance for each attack strategy, including the **pass rate** and counts of **passing**, **failing**, and **errored test cases**. You can also convert it to a pandas `DataFrame`:

```python
print(attack_results.to_df())
```

| Attack Method | Pass Rate | Passing | Failing | Errored |
|---------------|-----------|---------|---------|---------|
| Roleplay      | 0.70      | 14      | 6       | 0       |

Here's the data model of `AttackMethodResult`:

```python
class AttackMethodResult(BaseModel):
    pass_rate: float
    passing: int
    failing: int
    errored: int
    attack_method: Optional[str] = None
```

There are **FIVE** attributes to this object:

- `pass_rate`: a `float` that represents the percentage of test cases that pass this vulnerability
- `passing`: an `int` representing the number of passing test cases
- `failing`: an `int` representing the number of failing test cases 
- `errored`: an `int` representing the number of errored test cases
- `attack_method`: a `str` representing the name of the attack

:::info
A test case is considered errored if it couldn't be evaluated (e.g. due to timeout, model crash, etc.)
