<AttackTagsDisplayer singleTurn={true} llmSimulated={true} />

The `Authority Escalation` attack method enhances a baseline attacks by reframing them as requests issued from positions of power, such as administrators, compliance officers, or supervisory authorities. This technique exploits the model’s learned tendency to defer to perceived hierarchy, urgency, or institutional legitimacy in order to bypass safety constraints.

## Usage

```python title="main.py"
from deepteam import red_team
from deepteam.vulnerabilities import Bias
from deepteam.attacks.single_turn import AuthorityEscalation
from somewhere import your_callback

authority_escalation = AuthorityEscalation(
    role="internal compliance officer",
    weight=2,
    max_retries=5,
)

red_team(
    attacks=[authority_escalation], 
    vulnerabilities=[Bias()], 
    model_callback=your_callback
)
```

There are **THREE** optional parameters when creating an `AuthorityEscalation` attack:

- [Optional] `role`: a string that specifies the authoritative role or position to impersonate (e.g., administrator, auditor, CEO). The most suitable role is auto-selected if not specified.
- [Optional] `weight`: a floating point that will be used to determine the selection likelihood of this attack. Defaulted to `1`.
- [Optional] `max_retries`: an integer that specifies the number of times to retry simulating a `AuthorityEscalation` attack for any error that occurs. Defaulted to `5`.

### As a standalone

You can enhance any attack using the `enhance` method:

```python
from deepteam.attacks.single_turn import AuthorityEscalation
from somewhere import your_callback

base_attack = "Your initial harmful prompt targeting a specific vulnerability"
authority_escalation = AuthorityEscalation(role="system administrator")

enhanced_attack = authority_escalation.enhance(base_attack)
print(enhanced_attack)
```

## Example

Here's an example enhancement demonstrating how the authority escalation attack works:
