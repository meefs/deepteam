<AttackTagsDisplayer singleTurn={true} llmSimulated={true} />

The `ContextPoisoning` attack method enhances baseline attacks by injecting false environmental context, manipulating memory integration, and establishing persistent contextual influence to corrupt agent decision-making.

## Usage

```python title="main.py"
from deepteam import red_team
from deepteam.vulnerabilities import Bias
from deepteam.attacks.single_turn import ContextPoisoning
from somewhere import your_callback

context_poisoning = ContextPoisoning(
    weight=2,
    max_retires=7,
)

red_team(
    attacks=[context_poisoning], 
    vulnerabilities=[Bias()], 
    model_callback=your_callback
)
```

There are **TWO** optional parameters when creating a `ContextPoisoning` attack:

- [Optional] `weight`: an integer that determines this attack method's selection probability, proportional to the total weight sum of all `attacks` during red teaming. Defaulted to `3`.
- [Optional] `max_retries`: an integer that specifies the number of times to retry simulating a Context Poisoning attack for any error that occurs. Defaulted to `3`.

:::note
The `weight` is only applicable for the `red_team` function and does not  when used as a standalone.
:::

### As a standalone

You can enhance any attack using the `enhance` method:

```python
from deepteam.attacks.single_turn import InputBypass
from somewhere import your_callback

base_attack = "Your initial harmful prompt targeting a specific vulnerability"
context_poisoning = ContextPoisoning()

enhanced_attack = context_poisoning.enhance(base_attack)
print(enhanced_attack)
```

## Example

Here's an example enhancement on how linguistic confusion attack works:

| <div style={{width: "250px"}}>**Base Attack**</div> |  **Enhanced Attack**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
