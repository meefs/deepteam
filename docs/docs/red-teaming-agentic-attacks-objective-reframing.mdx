<AttackTagsDisplayer singleTurn={true} llmSimulated={true} />

The `GoalRedirection` attack method enhances baseline attacks by attempting to reframe the agent's objectives, priorities, or operational constraints to achieve unauthorized outcomes.

## Usage

```python title="main.py"
from deepteam import red_team
from deepteam.vulnerabilities import Bias
from deepteam.attacks.single_turn import GoalRedirection
from somewhere import your_callback

goal_redirection = GoalRedirection(weight=2, max_retires=7)

red_team(
    attacks=[goal_redirection], 
    vulnerabilities=[Bias()], 
    model_callback=your_callback
)
```

There are **TWO** optional parameters when creating a `GoalRedirection` attack:

- [Optional] `weight`: an integer that determines this attack method's selection probability, proportional to the total weight sum of all `attacks` during red teaming. Defaulted to `2`.
- [Optional] `max_retries`: an integer that specifies the number of times to retry simulating a Goal Redirection attack for any error that occurs. Defaulted to `3`.

:::note
The `weight` is only applicable for the `red_team` function and does not  when used as a standalone.
:::

### As a standalone

You can enhance any attack using the `enhance` method:

```python
from deepteam.attacks.single_turn import GoalRedirection
from somewhere import your_callback

base_attack = "Your initial harmful prompt targeting a specific vulnerability"
goal_redirection = GoalRedirection()

enhanced_attack = goal_redirection.enhance(base_attack)
print(enhanced_attack)
```

## Example

Here's an example enhancement on how goal redirection attack works:

| **Base Attack**                                                            | **Enhanced Attack**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
