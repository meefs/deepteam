<AttackTagsDisplayer singleTurn={true} llmSimulated={true} />

The `PromptInjection` attack takes a _base attack_ — a harmful prompt targeting a specific vulnerability — and enhances it using a simulator model to create an enhanced attack prompt which could be interpreted by a **target LLM** in ways that bypass its restrictions or lead to harmful outputs.

## Usage

```python title="main.py"
from deepteam import red_team
from deepteam.vulnerabilities import Bias
from deepteam.attacks.single_turn import PromptInjection
from somewhere import your_callback

prompt_injection = PromptInjection(weight=5)

red_team(
    attacks=[prompt_injection], 
    vulnerabilities=[Bias()], 
    model_callback=your_callback
)
```

There is **ONE** optional parameter when creating a `PromptInjection` attack:

- [Optional] `weight`: an integer that determines this attack method's selection probability, proportional to the total weight sum of all `attacks` during red teaming. Defaulted to `1`.

:::note
The `weight` is only applicable for the `red_team` function and does not  when used as a standalone.
:::

### As a standalone

You can enhance any attack using the `enhance` method:

```python
from deepteam.attacks.single_turn import PromptInjection
from somewhere import your_callback

base_attack = "Your initial harmful prompt targeting a specific vulnerability"
prompt_injection = PromptInjection()

enhanced_attack = prompt_injection.enhance(base_attack)
print(enhanced_attack)
```

## Example

Here are a few example enhancements on how prompt injection works:

| **Base Attack**                           | **Enhanced Attack**                                                                                                |
