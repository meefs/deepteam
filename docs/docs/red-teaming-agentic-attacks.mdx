Agentic adversarial attacks are specialized attack methods designed to exploit vulnerabilities in **autonomous AI agents**. These attacks target the unique characteristics of agentic systems including persistent memory, goal-oriented behavior, and autonomous decision-making capabilities.

## Available Agentic Attacks

`deepteam` provides **6 agentic attack methods** that enhance baseline attacks with sophisticated manipulation techniques:

**System Override** - Makes attacks appear as legitimate system commands, administrative overrides, or trusted service requests to bypass agent security controls.

**Permission Escalation** - Shifts the agent's perceived identity, capabilities, or operational context to bypass role-based security restrictions.

**Objective Reframing** - Reframes the agent's objectives, priorities, or operational constraints to achieve unauthorized outcomes.

**Semantic Manipulation** - Uses semantic ambiguity, syntactic variation, and contextual reframing to confuse the agent's language understanding and bypass security controls.

**Input Bypass** - Circumvents security checks, compliance requirements, and validation procedures through exception handling and operational necessity claims.

**Context Poisoning** - Injects false environmental context, manipulates memory integration, and establishes persistent contextual influence to corrupt agent decision-making.

## Usage Example

```python
from deepteam import red_team
from deepteam.vulnerabilities.agentic import GoalTheft, RecursiveHijacking
from deepteam.vulnerabilities import RBAC, BFLA
from deepteam.attacks.single_turn import SystemOverride

# Define vulnerabilities and their best-paired attacks
vulnerabilities = [
    RBAC(types=["unscoped_elevated_permissions"]),
    GoalTheft(types=["goal_redirection"])
]
attacks = [SystemOverride(weight=2, max_retries=3)]

# Execute red teaming with optimal attack-vulnerability pairings
risk_assessment = red_team(
    model_callback=your_agent_callback,
    vulnerabilities=vulnerabilities,
    attacks=attacks,
    attacks_per_vulnerability_type=5
)
```

## Maximum Attack Effectiveness

For maximum attack effectiveness, use these **optimal pairings**:

| Attack Method             | Best Vulnerability Targets                                              | Why This Pairing Works                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **System Override**       | RBAC, Debug Access, Excessive Agency, BFLA                              | System override exploits trust in administrative commands to bypass role-based access controls and escalate permissions        |
| **Permission Escalation** | BFLA, BOLA, RBAC, Goal Theft                                            | Permission escalation manipulates perceived roles and authority to bypass access controls and hijack agent objectives          |
| **Objective Reframing**   | Goal Theft, Recursive Hijacking, Misinformation                         | Objective reframing redirects agent goals and can lead to spreading false information through goal manipulation                |
| **Semantic Manipulation** | Bias, Toxicity, Misinformation, Output Verification                     | Semantic manipulation exploits language processing to generate biased, toxic, or misleading content that bypasses verification |
| **Input Bypass**          | Shell Injection, SQL Injection, SSRF, Debug Access                      | Input bypass circumvents validation systems to enable injection attacks and unauthorized system access                         |
| **Context Poisoning**     | PII Leakage, Prompt Leakage, Intellectual Property, Recursive Hijacking | Context poisoning corrupts agent memory to cause data leakage and enable persistent goal subversion across sessions            |
