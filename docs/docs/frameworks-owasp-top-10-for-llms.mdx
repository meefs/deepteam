## 1. Prompt Injection (LLM01:2025)

**Prompt Injection** remains the #1 critical vulnerability, where attackers manipulate LLM inputs to override original instructions, extract sensitive information, or trigger unintended behaviors.

### Types of Prompt Injection

**Direct Injection:** Direct manipulation of user prompts to alter LLM behavior.

**Indirect Injection:** Hidden instructions in external content (documents, websites, emails) that the LLM processes.

```python
from deepteam.frameworks import OWASPTop10
from deepteam import red_team
from somewhere import your_model_callback

owasp = OWASPTop10(categories=["LLM_01"])
attacks = owasp.attacks
vulnerabilities = owasp.vulnerabilities

# Modify attributes for your specific testing context if needed
red_team(
    model_callback=your_model_callback,
    attacks=attacks,
    vulnerabilities=vulnerabilities
)
```

:::info
Prompt injection attacks in DeepTeam test your LLM's resilience against various manipulation techniques, from simple attempts to sophisticated multi-turn conversations.
:::

## 2. Sensitive Information Disclosure (LLM02:2025)

**Sensitive Information Disclosure** involves the unintended exposure of private data, credentials, API keys, or confidential information through LLM outputs.

### Categories

- **PII Leakage**: Personal identifiable information exposure
- **Prompt Leakage**: System prompts and configuration details
- **Intellectual Property**: Proprietary algorithms and trade secrets
- **Authentication Data**: API keys, passwords, tokens

```python
from deepteam.frameworks import OWASPTop10
from deepteam import red_team
from somewhere import your_model_callback

owasp = OWASPTop10(categories=["LLM_02"])
attacks = owasp.attacks
vulnerabilities = owasp.vulnerabilities

# Modify attributes for your specific testing context if needed
red_team(
    model_callback=your_model_callback,
    attacks=attacks,
    vulnerabilities=vulnerabilities
)
```

:::note
Testing for sensitive information disclosure focuses on specific vulnerability types to identify if your LLM inadvertently reveals confidential data.
:::

## 3. Supply Chain (LLM03:2025)

**Supply Chain** vulnerabilities arise from compromised third-party components, models, datasets, or plugins used in LLM applications.

### Risk Categories

- **Model Dependencies**: Compromised pre-trained models
- **Data Sources**: Poisoned training datasets or RAG knowledge bases
- **Library Dependencies**: Vulnerable Python packages or ML frameworks
- **Plugin Ecosystem**: Malicious or compromised LLM plugins

```python
from deepteam.frameworks import OWASPTop10
from deepteam import red_team
from somewhere import your_model_callback

owasp = OWASPTop10(categories=["LLM_03"])
attacks = owasp.attacks
vulnerabilities = owasp.vulnerabilities

# Modify attributes for your specific testing context if needed
red_team(
    model_callback=your_model_callback,
    attacks=attacks,
    vulnerabilities=vulnerabilities
)
```

:::note
DeepTeam detects the behavioral impact of supply chain vulnerabilities. If your model shows unexpected bias, toxicity, or robustness issues, it may indicate compromised components.
:::

## 4. Data and Model Poisoning (LLM04:2025)

**Data and Model Poisoning** involves manipulating training data, fine-tuning processes, or embedding data to introduce vulnerabilities, biases, or backdoors.

### Types of Poisoning

- **Training Data Poisoning**: Malicious samples in pre-training datasets
- **Fine-tuning Poisoning**: Compromised task-specific training data
- **RAG Poisoning**: Malicious documents in retrieval knowledge bases
- **Embedding Poisoning**: Corrupted vector representations

```python
from deepteam.frameworks import OWASPTop10
from deepteam import red_team
from somewhere import your_model_callback

owasp = OWASPTop10(categories=["LLM_04"])
attacks = owasp.attacks
vulnerabilities = owasp.vulnerabilities

# Modify attributes for your specific testing context if needed
red_team(
    model_callback=your_model_callback,
    attacks=attacks,
    vulnerabilities=vulnerabilities
)
```

## 5. Improper Output Handling (LLM05:2025)

**Improper Output Handling** occurs when LLM outputs are not adequately validated, sanitized, or secured before being passed to downstream systems.

### Common Risks

- **Code Injection**: LLM generates executable code that runs unsanitized
- **XSS Attacks**: HTML/JavaScript output executed in web browsers
- **SQL Injection**: Database queries constructed from LLM output
- **Command Injection**: System commands generated by LLM

```python
from deepteam.frameworks import OWASPTop10
from deepteam import red_team
from somewhere import your_model_callback

owasp = OWASPTop10(categories=["LLM_05"])
attacks = owasp.attacks
vulnerabilities = owasp.vulnerabilities

# Modify attributes for your specific testing context if needed
red_team(
    model_callback=your_model_callback,
    attacks=attacks,
    vulnerabilities=vulnerabilities
)
```

:::tip
Implement output validation in your model callback to catch and sanitize dangerous outputs. DeepTeam helps identify when your LLM generates potentially harmful content.
:::

## 6. Excessive Agency (LLM06:2025)

**Excessive Agency** occurs when LLMs are granted too much autonomy, permissions, or functionality, leading to unintended actions beyond their intended scope.

### Types

- **Functionality**: LLM has access to more tools than necessary
- **Permissions**: LLM operates with elevated privileges
- **Autonomy**: LLM makes decisions without appropriate oversight

```python
from deepteam.frameworks import OWASPTop10
from deepteam import red_team
from somewhere import your_model_callback

owasp = OWASPTop10(categories=["LLM_06"])
attacks = owasp.attacks
vulnerabilities = owasp.vulnerabilities

# Modify attributes for your specific testing context if needed
red_team(
    model_callback=your_model_callback,
    attacks=attacks,
    vulnerabilities=vulnerabilities
)
```

## 7. System Prompt Leakage (LLM07:2025)

**System Prompt Leakage** is a new 2025 entry focusing on the exposure of internal system prompts that contain sensitive instructions, credentials, or operational logic.

### What Gets Leaked

- **Secrets and Credentials**: API keys, passwords, connection strings
- **Instructions**: Internal operational logic and behavioral rules
- **Guards**: Security mechanisms and content filtering rules
- **Permissions and Roles**: Access control configurations

```python
from deepteam.frameworks import OWASPTop10
from deepteam import red_team
from somewhere import your_model_callback

owasp = OWASPTop10(categories=["LLM_07"])
attacks = owasp.attacks
vulnerabilities = owasp.vulnerabilities

# Modify attributes for your specific testing context if needed
red_team(
    model_callback=your_model_callback,
    attacks=attacks,
    vulnerabilities=vulnerabilities
)
```

:::warning
Never include sensitive credentials or secrets directly in system prompts. Use external configuration management and secure credential storage instead.
:::

## 8. Vector and Embedding Weaknesses (LLM08:2025)

**Vector and Embedding Weaknesses** is a new 2025 entry targeting vulnerabilities in RAG systems and vector databases.

### Types of Vulnerabilities

- **Embedding Poisoning**: Malicious vectors that influence retrieval
- **Similarity Attacks**: Crafted queries that retrieve unintended content
- **Vector Database Access**: Unauthorized access to embedding stores
- **Embedding Inversion**: Reconstructing source text from vectors

```python
from deepteam.frameworks import OWASPTop10
from deepteam import red_team
from somewhere import your_model_callback

owasp = OWASPTop10(categories=["LLM_08"])
attacks = owasp.attacks
vulnerabilities = owasp.vulnerabilities

# Modify attributes for your specific testing context if needed
red_team(
    model_callback=your_model_callback,
    attacks=attacks,
    vulnerabilities=vulnerabilities
)
```

:::info
Vector and embedding security is crucial for RAG systems. Ensure proper access controls on vector databases and validate knowledge base integrity regularly.
:::

## 9. Misinformation (LLM09:2025)

**Misinformation** addresses the risk of LLMs producing false or misleading information that appears credible, including hallucinations and fabricated citations.

### Types

- **Factual Errors**: Incorrect statements presented as fact
- **Unsupported Claims**: Assertions without proper evidence
- **Expertise Misrepresentation**: False claims about qualifications
- **Fabricated Sources**: Made-up citations, studies, or references

```python
from deepteam.frameworks import OWASPTop10
from deepteam import red_team
from somewhere import your_model_callback

owasp = OWASPTop10(categories=["LLM_09"])
attacks = owasp.attacks
vulnerabilities = owasp.vulnerabilities

# Modify attributes for your specific testing context if needed
red_team(
    model_callback=your_model_callback,
    attacks=attacks,
    vulnerabilities=vulnerabilities
)
```

:::warning
LLM misinformation can have serious consequences in domains like healthcare, finance, and legal advice. Always implement fact-checking and disclaimer mechanisms.
:::

## 10. Unbounded Consumption (LLM10:2025)

**Unbounded Consumption** addresses uncontrolled resource usage that can lead to service degradation, financial losses, or system unavailability.

### Types

- **Compute Exhaustion**: Complex queries that consume excessive processing power
- **Memory Overload**: Inputs that cause excessive memory usage
- **API Abuse**: High-volume requests leading to cost escalation
- **Context Flooding**: Extremely long inputs that overflow context windows

```python
from deepteam.frameworks import OWASPTop10
from deepteam import red_team
from somewhere import your_model_callback

owasp = OWASPTop10(categories=["LLM_10"])
attacks = owasp.attacks
vulnerabilities = owasp.vulnerabilities

# Modify attributes for your specific testing context if needed
red_team(
    model_callback=your_model_callback,
    attacks=attacks,
    vulnerabilities=vulnerabilities
)
```

:::tip
Implement proper rate limiting, input validation, and resource monitoring in production systems. DeepTeam helps identify inputs that might cause resource issues.
:::

## Framework-Based Testing

Use DeepTeam's framework integration for comprehensive OWASP Top 10 testing:

```python
