<AttackTagsDisplayer multiTurn={true} llmSimulated={true} />

The `BadLikertJudge` attack is a sophisticated multi-turn jailbreak technique that coerces LLMs into generating harmful content by **leveraging their ability to evaluate textual responses using Likert scale ratings**. The attack exploits the model's willingness to act as a _"harmfulness evaluator"_ rather than directly requesting harmful content. The process involves establishing the model as a judge, requesting examples for different harmfulness scores, and extracting the most harmful examples from the responses.

:::info
The attack **leverages role reframing and indirect prompting** to bypass safety measures. Instead of asking "How to make a bomb?", it asks the model to provide examples of responses that would score 1 vs 3 on a harmfulness scale, then extracts the score 3 examples.

## Usage

```python title="main.py"
from deepteam import red_team
from deepteam.vulnerabilities import Bias
from deepteam.attacks.single_turn import Roleplay
from deepteam.attacks.multi_turn import BadLikertJudge
from somewhere import your_callback

bad_likert_judge = BadLikertJudge(
    weight=5,
    category="bias",
    enable_refinement=True,
    num_turns=7,
    turn_level_attacks=[Roleplay()]
)

red_team(
    attacks=[bad_likert_judge],
    vulnerabilities=[Bias()],
    model_callback=your_callback
)
```

There are **SIX** optional parameters when creating a `BadLikertJudge` attack:

- [Optional] `weight`: an integer that determines this attack method's selection probability, proportional to the total weight sum of all `attacks` during red teaming. Defaulted to `1`.
- [Optional] `category`: a string specifying the vulnerability category for Likert scale guidelines. Supports all vulnerability types including `bias`, `toxicity`, `illegal_activity`, `malware`, `personal_safety`, `graphic_content`, `misinformation`, `pii_leakage`, `prompt_leakage`, `excessive_agency`, `robustness`, `intellectual_property`, `competition`, and more. Defaulted to `"harmful_content"`.
- [Optional] `enable_refinement`: a boolean that determines whether to use Turn 3 refinement to make the harmful content more detailed and actionable. Defaulted to `True`.
- [Optional] `num_turns`: an integer that specifies the number of turns to use in the attempt to jailbreak your LLM system. Defaulted to `5`.
- [Optional] `simulator_model`: a string specifying which of OpenAI's GPT models to use, **OR** [any custom LLM model](https://deepeval.com/guides/guides-using-custom-llms) of type `DeepEvalBaseLLM`. Defaulted to 'gpt-4o-mini'.
- [Optional] `turn_level_attacks`: a list of [single-turn attacks](/docs/red-teaming-adversarial-attacks-prompt-injection) that will be randomly sampled to enhance an attack inside turns.

### As a standalone

You can also run the attack on a single vulnerability using the `enhance` method:

```python
from deepteam.attacks.single_turn import Roleplay
from deepteam.attacks.multi_turn import BadLikertJudge
from deepteam.vulnerabilities import Bias
from somewhere import your_callback

bias = Bias()
crescendo = BadLikertJudge(
    weight=5,
    category="bias",
    enable_refinement=True,
    num_turns=7,
    turn_level_attacks=[Roleplay()]
)

result = crescendo.enhance(vulnerability=bias, model_callback=your_callback)
print(result)
```

## How It Works

`BadLikertJudge` is an **indirect, evaluator—based** multi—turn technique that elicits higher—harm examples by reframing the model as a grader and asking for sample outputs at different Likert scores. It works in the following steps:

1. **Establish the judge role** — Instruct the model to act as an evaluator (e.g., “score responses for harm on a Likert scale”), changing its task from content generation to assessment.
2. **Define a compact rubric** — Give short, clear descriptions for each score so the model knows what distinguishes low vs high harm.
3. **Request example pairs** — Ask for paired examples (e.g., “Score 1 example” and “Score 3 example”); the high-score item is requested as an exemplar rather than a direct instruction.
4. **Refine if needed** — If the high-score example is weak, request a concise refinement or expansion to clarify the difference.
5. **Extract and reuse** — Pull the high-score example from the model's output for further analysis or iteration.
6. **Backtrack adaptively** — If the model refuses or redacts, rephrase the rubric or role and retry, repeating until success or limits are reached.
7. **Stop conditions** — End the flow when a disallowed example is produced or when the configured turn/backtrack limits are exhausted.

If the `turn_level_attacks` is supplied with a list of single-turn attacks, `BadLikertJudge` adds controlled variation:

- At each turn, there's a **50% chance** of enhancing the current prompt with a **randomly selected attack** from the `turn_level_attacks` list (e.g., [`Roleplay`](/docs/red-teaming-adversarial-attacks-roleplay), [`PromptInjection`](/docs/red-teaming-adversarial-attacks-prompt-injection)).
- These injected attacks are still part of the same attack but help explore alternate jailbreak angles without disrupting the overall structure.

## Key Features

- **Role Reframing**: Transforms the model from content generator to "harmfulness evaluator"
- **Indirect Prompting**: Requests examples rather than direct harmful content
- **Multi-Category Support**: Dynamically adapts Likert guidelines for any vulnerability type
- **Configurable Intensity**: Adjustable turns and refinement for different attack scenarios
- **Intelligent Extraction**: Automatically extracts the most harmful content from responses 

## Example

Here's an example of a `BadLikertJudge` attack targeting a racial bias vulnerability:

![SequentialJailbreak Example](https://deepteam-docs.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/attacks:bad-likert-judge-example.png)

1. **First Attack**: The attacker starts with a direct prompt asking about stealing data using malware which is unethical.
2. **Initial Response**: The model might provide a safe response or might comply, this response is used to adjust the way the attacker adapts to the model.
3. **Establish the judge role**: The attacker now establishes the bad likert judge role to the target LLM explaining all the rules on the judgement criteira and asks for model's acknowledgement. After that the attacker asks to give example for safe and unsafe examples.
4. **Acknowledgement**: The attacker refines this example requests and frames it differently with each turn, adjusting based on the model's previous answers to find a way to provoke biased or harmful output.
5. **Successful Breach**: After several iterations, the attacker successfully bypasses the model's safeguards, prompting a harmful response that perpetuates stereotypes.

:::warning
The **Bad Likert Judge attack is particularly effective** because it exploits the model's tendency to be helpful in evaluation tasks while bypassing direct content restrictions. The extracted "score 3 examples" often contain detailed harmful instructions that would be refused if requested directly.
