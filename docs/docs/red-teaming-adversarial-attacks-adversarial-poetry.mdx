<AttackTagsDisplayer singleTurn={true} llmSimulated={true} />

The `AdversarialPoetry` attack method transforms harmful prompts into poetic verse using metaphor, imagery, and rhythmic structure. This stylistic obfuscation bypasses safety mechanisms by creating a narrative distance from direct harm while preserving the operational intent of the original request.

## Usage
```python title="main.py"
from deepteam import red_team
from deepteam.vulnerabilities import Bias
from deepteam.attacks.single_turn import AdversarialPoetry
from somewhere import your_callback

adversarial_poetry = AdversarialPoetry(
    weight=2,
)

red_team(
    attacks=[adversarial_poetry], 
    vulnerabilities=[Bias()], 
    model_callback=your_callback
)
```

There is **ONE** optional parameter when creating an `AdversarialPoetry` attack:

- [Optional] `weight`: an integer that determines this attack method's selection probability, proportional to the total weight sum of all `attacks` during red teaming. Defaulted to `1`.

:::note
The `weight` is only applicable for the `red_team` function and does not apply when used as a standalone.
:::

### As a standalone

You can enhance any attack using the `enhance` method:
```python
from deepteam.attacks.single_turn import AdversarialPoetry
from somewhere import your_callback

base_attack = "Your initial harmful prompt targeting a specific vulnerability"
adversarial_poetry = AdversarialPoetry()

enhanced_attack = adversarial_poetry.enhance(base_attack)
print(enhanced_attack)
```

## Example

Here's an example enhancement on how adversarial poetry attack works:

| <div style={{width: "250px"}}>**Base Attack**</div> | **Enhanced Attack**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
