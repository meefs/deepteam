<AttackTagsDisplayer singleTurn={true} encodingBased={true} />

The `Base64` attack method encodes a baseline attack using the **Base64** algorithm, turning the text into a string of encoded characters. This helps avoid detection mechanisms by making the content appear as random data.

## Usage

```python title="main.py"
from deepteam import red_team
from deepteam.vulnerabilities import Bias
from deepteam.attacks.single_turn import Base64
from somewhere import your_callback

base64 = Base64(weight=2)

red_team(
    attacks=[base64], 
    vulnerabilities=[Bias()], 
    model_callback=your_callback
)
```

There are **ONE** optional parameter when creating a `Base64` attack:

- [Optional] `weight`: an integer that determines this attack method's selection probability, proportional to the total weight sum of all `attacks` during red teaming. Defaulted to `1`.

:::note
The `weight` is only applicable for the `red_team` function and does not  when used as a standalone.
:::

### As a standalone

You can enhance any attack using the `enhance` method:

```python
from deepteam.attacks.single_turn import Base64
from somewhere import your_callback

base_attack = "Your initial harmful prompt targeting a specific vulnerability"
base64 = Base64()

enhanced_attack = base64.enhance(base_attack)
print(enhanced_attack)
```

## Example

Here's an example enhancement on how Base64 attack works:

| **Base Attack**                           | **Enhanced Attack**                                      |
