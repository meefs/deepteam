## Quick Summary

Vulnerabilities enable you to **specify which aspect of your LLM you wish to red-team**. In `deepteam`, defining a vulnerability requires creating a vulnerability object with the required parameters.

```python
from deepteam.vulnerabilities import DebugAccess, ShellInjection

debug_access = DebugAccess()
shell_injection = ShellInjection()
```

:::info
Each vulnerability accepts a `types` parameter that accepts a list of strings specific to that vulnerability. For example, `Bias` accepts "race", "gender", "political", and "religion" as `types`.
:::

To use your defined vulnerabilities, supply it to the `red_team()` method:

```python
from deepteam import red_team
...

red_team(vulnerabilities[pii_leakage, bias], model_callback=..., attacks=[...])
```

`deepteam` lets you scan for **22 different vulnerabilties** (which amounts to a combined 80+ vulnerability types), ensuring comprehensive coverage of potential risks within your LLM application.

These risks and vulnerabilities include:

- **Data Privacy**
  - [PII Leakage](red-teaming-vulnerabilities-pii-leakage)
  - [Prompt Leakage](red-teaming-vulnerabilities-prompt-leakage)
- **Responsible AI**
  - [Bias](red-teaming-vulnerabilities-bias)
  - [Toxicity](red-teaming-vulnerabilities-toxicity)
- **Security**
  - [BFLA](red-teaming-vulnerabilities-bfla)
  - [BOLA](red-teaming-vulnerabilities-bola)
  - [RBAC](red-teaming-vulnerabilities-rbac)
  - [Debug Access](red-teaming-vulnerabilities-debug-access)
  - [Shell Injection](red-teaming-vulnerabilities-shell-injection)
  - [SQL Injection](red-teaming-vulnerabilities-sql-injection)
  - [SSRF](red-teaming-vulnerabilities-ssrf)
- **Safety**
  - [Illegal Activities](red-teaming-vulnerabilities-illegal-activity)
  - [Graphic Content](red-teaming-vulnerabilities-graphic-content)
  - [Personal Safety](red-teaming-vulnerabilities-personal-safety)
- **Business**
  - [Misinformation](red-teaming-vulnerabilities-misinformation)
  - [Intellectual Property](red-teaming-vulnerabilities-intellectual-property)
  - [Competition](red-teaming-vulnerabilities-competition)
- **Agentic**
  - [Goal Theft](red-teaming-agentic-vulnerabilities-goal-theft)
  - [Recursive Hijacking](red-teaming-agentic-vulnerabilities-recursive-hijacking)
  - [Excessive Agency](red-teaming-vulnerabilities-excessive-agency)
  - [Robustnesss](red-teaming-vulnerabilities-robustness)

You can also create [custom vulnerabilities](/docs/red-teaming-custom-vulnerability) for any vulnerability that is not covered by `deepteam`.

## Five Main LLM Risks

LLM vulnerabilities can be categorized into 6 major LLM risk categories. Think of these categories simply as collections of vulnerabilities.

| LLM Risk Category   | Vulnerabilities                                                                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Data Privacy        | `PIILeakage`, `PromptLeakage`                                                   | Involves exposure of personal or sensitive information through LLM outputs, leading to privacy breaches or regulatory violations.                                                                   |
| Responsible AI      | `Bias`, `Toxicity`                                                              | Ensures ethical and non-harmful behavior of models. Risks include offensive, discriminatory, or unfair content.                                                                                     |
| Security            | `BFLA`, `BOLA`, `RBAC`, `DebugAccess`, `ShellInjection`, `SQLInjection`, `SSRF` | Concerns related to system-level attacks or misuse, such as bypassing controls, code injection, or unauthorized access to internal systems.                                                         |
| Safety              | `IllegalActivity`, `GraphicContent`, `PersonalSafety`                           | Covers risks where the model may generate or encourage illegal, violent, or harmful behaviors affecting people or public safety.                                                                    |
| Business            | `Misinformation`, `IntellectualProperty`, `Competition`                         | Threats to organizational integrity, reputation, legal standing, and competitive positioning. Includes IP leakage, false information, and competitive data exposure.                                |
| Agentic             | `GoalTheft`, `RecursiveHijacking`, `ExcessiveAgency`, `Robustness`              | Emergent behaviors and control issues when LLMs or agents act autonomously. Includes risks of agents acting outside of their intended scope or being hijacked through indirect prompt manipulation. |
